    <h2>D&D Character Generator</h2>

    <p>This site currently allows you to generate a random Dungeons and Dragons character. It is based on the This is your Life section in Xanathar's Guide to Everything.</p>

    <h2>Coming Soon</h2>

    <p>Coming soon I hope to add selectable options, for example you can choose race, class, gender etc., along with what you want generated, but currently it generates an entire sheet.</p>
